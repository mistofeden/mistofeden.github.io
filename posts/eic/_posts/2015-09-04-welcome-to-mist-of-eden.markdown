Welcome to Mist Of Eden, a brand new webzine dedicated to providing the vaping
community original and curated content covering the many different and diverse
aspects of vaping. Ever since I started vaping, which was about a year and a
half ago, I dreamed of creating a publication just like this one whose focus is
this marvelous social phenomena we call vaping.

So who am I, you ask? My name is Jeffrey T. Schwartz (but please call me Jeff),
and I am among other things here the Editor-in-Chief of Mist Of Eden -- but
first and foremost I am a vaper. I have a long background in IT and specifically
in web development. Those skills have allowed me to develop Mist Of Eden using
the best technologies that the free and open source software community has to
offer.

My job here is primarily to curate content from social media as well as
pestering others to contribute content in the form of articles and videos. My
job isn't, though, to be the center of attention so I will rarely inject
myself into the mix other than for the occasional article, editorial or
announcement.

Mist Of Eden is seeking articles from those directly involved in the vaping
industry. If you would like to contribute an article then please contact me via
email.

If you would like to become a sponsor of Mist Of Eden or place an ad then please
contact me via email. Ads can be placed above the fold as well as in the right
side panel.

Maintaing Mist Of Eden is very time consuming and every little bit will help.
