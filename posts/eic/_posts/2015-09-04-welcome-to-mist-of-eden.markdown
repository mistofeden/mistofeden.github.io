Welcome to Mist Of Eden, my new blogging platform and webzine dedicated to
providing the vaping community with original and curated content covering the
many different and diverse aspects of vaping.

Ever since I started vaping, which was about a year and a half ago, I dreamed of
creating a publication just like this one, focusing on this marvelous social
phenomena we call vaping.

I also have a long background in IT and specifically in web development. Those
skills have allowed me to develop Mist Of Eden using the best technologies that
the free and open source software community has to offer.

Mist Of Eden is seeking articles from those directly involved in the vaping
industry. If you would like to contribute an article then please contact me via
email.

If you would like to become a sponsor of Mist Of Eden or place an ad here then
please contact me via email. Ads can be placed above the fold as well as in the
right side panel. Maintaing Mist Of Eden is very time consuming and every little
bit will help.
