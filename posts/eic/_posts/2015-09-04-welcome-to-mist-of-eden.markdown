Welcome to Mist Of Eden, my new blogging platform and webzine dedicated to
providing the vaping community with original and curated content covering the
many different and diverse aspects of vaping.

Ever since I started vaping about a year and a half ago, I dreamed of
creating a publication just like this one, focusing on this marvelous social
phenomena we call vaping.

My profesional background is in IT, specifically web development, so I decided
to build my own blogging site based on the best technologies that the free and
open source software community has to offer. Mist Of Eden is not yet complete.
It is in fact a continuous work in progress. So readers shouldn't be surprised
to see things dramatically changing as I experiment with new and innovative
concepts.
